            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li>Spicy sauce</li>
                <li>Chicken</li>
                <li>Noodles</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place carrots, cabbage, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic in a mixing bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Mix chicken broth, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, sriracha sauce, and
                    red
                    pepper flakes together in a separate mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Place dry rice noodles in a large mixing bowl. Cover with about 6 cups boiling water; add a pinch of
                    salt. Stir from time to time until noodles are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain; cool with cold water.
                    Drain thoroughly. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add shredded chicken; drizzle with sesame oil. Toss to
                    coat.</li>
                <li>Heat large skillet over high heat; drizzle in vegetable oil. When oil is hot (almost but not quite
                    smoking), add the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until vegetables are hot and steamy, 1 or 2
                    minutes.
                    Pour in sauce; cook and stir over high heat until sauce starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Add
                    noodles
                    and chicken. Cook and stir to blend ingredients and ensure ingredients are hot, about 1 minute.
                    Remove
                    from heat. Add chopped cilantro; stir.</li>
